Nix builders for [Deno](https://deno.land) projects.

Still a WIP, but here's what works / is done:

- [x] `denoPlatform.mkDenoDir`: cache Deno dependencies in a pure Nix expression, no external scripts needed.
- [x] scripts without dependencies.
- [x] https://deno.land, https://esm.sh style dependencies. 
- [x] NPM dependencies. I use this repo to build my [Lume](https://lume.land) website, which has lots of NPM dependencies, please open an issue if you run into NPM problems!
- [x] `denoPlatform.mkDenoDerivation`: a basic `stdenv.mkDerivation` wrapper that handles dependencies for you.
- [x] helper for `deno compile`.
- [x] helper for `deno bundle`. Newer alternatives like `deno_emit` are still a TODO.
- [ ] more helpful docs, right now, I'd suggest having a look at [`./ci.nix`](./ci.nix) for basic usage info.
- [ ] a release.
